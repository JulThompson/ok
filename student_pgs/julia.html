        <p class="big">It was definitely intimidating getting fully into computer science 
            for the first time last year,</p>
        <p class="big">but thanks to your help I've enjoyed it and made all 
            of <a href="https://github.com/JulThompson">this</a>!</p>
    </div>

    <p class="big">It's been a really fun two years having you for Intro to Computer Science, SQL, and a little bit of AP</p>
    <p>Even when it wasn't so fun (like when I got sick both years right before labs/tests), 
        you've helped make things easier and were so accomodating.</p>
    <p>I've also learned from you in ways outside of your class, like using your web app tutorials
        for <a href="'https://github.com/ishaaty/clothingPickerMidyear">midyear</a> this past year!</p>
    <p>I cannot express how much it has helped to have a teacher like you as I got accustomed to life at BCA!</p>
    <p id="end">I'm sad to see you go and will miss you, but I appreciate you for helping me discover 
        my passion for CS and always treating us with kindness!</p>
    <h2>Good luck with whatever you do next!</h2>
