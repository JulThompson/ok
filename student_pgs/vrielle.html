        <h2>Dear Mr. Wang,</h2>

        <p>Thank you so much for two amazing CS filled years! You have always been so supportive of me, my friends, 
            and our work in the many CS classes we've had with you. I've learned not only so many CS topics from you 
            like Python, Java, and WebDev, but also life lessons like how to go above and beyond our original goals and 
            how to be gentle on ourselves when life gets tough. You were the first teacher I ever had who was so honest 
            and genuine, and I believe that helped me to learn and grow knowing I was being taught by someone who goes 
            through some of the same struggles I go through. I was able to relate to you and grow so much respect for you, 
            which has made my high school experience entirely better. I hope that even with the job or plans you move onto next,
            you never forget about us! And please do come back to see our Capstone projects. <3
        </p>

        <h1>Thank you so much for everything Mr. Wang! I miss you so much!</h1>
